#Brain Money Killer

Note that this is a forked modification and reimplementation https://github.com/vladkens/ecloop

A high-performance, CPU-optimized tool with the ability to search compressed and uncompressed addresses, as well as customizable puzzle-based searches for private keys and brainwallet searches.


#Features
🍏 Fixed 256-bit modulo operations, fixed a private key partitioning issue, fixed the secp256k1 core, improved speed, and used AVX2 sha256 and ripemd160 for high-speed computation.
🔄 Group inversion of point addition
🍇 Precomputed tables for integral multiplication
🔍 Search for compressed and uncompressed public keys (hash160)
🌟 Optimized sha256 and ripemd160 using SIMD and AVX2 (using SHA extensions for ARM and Intel)
🍎 Runs seamlessly on macOS and Linux
🔧 Customizable search range and number of threads for flexible usage

#usage
```
./Brainmk -h
Usage: ./Brainmk <cmd> [-t <threads>] [-b <bloom_file>] [-f <hash_list>] [-a <addr_type>] [-r <range>] [-sha]
v.8891689

Compute commands:
  puzzle          - Performs efficient search within a given range, suitable for puzzle games.
  brain           - Search from standard input. Defaults to a hexadecimal private key; brainwallet attacks require the -sha flag.

Compute options:
  -b <file>       - bloom filter file
  -f <file>       - hash list file for second confirmation
  -o <file>       - output file (default: stdout)
  -t <threads>    - number of threads to run (default: 1)
  -a <addr_type>  - address type to search: c addr33(compressed), u addr65(uncompressed), (default: c)
  -r <range>      - (for puzzle mode) search range in hex format (example: 8000:ffff)
  -q              - quiet mode (no stdout; must use -o)
  -sha            - (For brainwallet mode) Treats the standard input line as a raw text password and encrypts the computed private key using SHA256.
```


Other commands:

  bloom         - create bloom filter from list of hex-encoded hash160

# Instructions: Brainmk <command> [-t <number of threads>] [-f <file path>] [-a <addr type>] [-r <range>]

Calculation command:
puzzle: Performs an efficient search within a given range, suitable for puzzle games.
brain: Searches from standard input. Defaults to a hexadecimal private key; brainwallet attacks require the -sha flag.
Calculation options:
-f <file>: Hash list file for second confirmation.
-b <file>: Bloom filter file.
-o <file>: Specifies the output file to save the found key (defaults to standard output).
-t <threads>: Sets the number of threads to run (default: 1).
-a <addr_type>: Sets the address type to search: c - addr33, u - addr65 (default: c).
-r <range>: Specifies the search range, in hexadecimal format (e.g., 8000:ffff, defaults to searching all).
-q: Silent mode (no output to standard output; you must specify an output file with -o).
-sha: (For brainwallet mode) Treats the standard input line as a raw text password and encrypts the computed private key using SHA256.

Other commands:

bloom: Creates a Bloom filter from a list of hexadecimal-encoded hash160 values.

#Example 1: Check for keys in a given range (append sequentially)
-f is the filter file with hash160 to search. This can be a list of hex-encoded hashes (one per line) or a bloom filter (must have a .blf extension). -t uses 4 threads. –r is the start:end of the search range. -o is the file where the found keys should be saved (if not provided, stdout is padded). No -a option is provided, so c will check the (compressed) hash160.   Test platform: Linux/Debian, Intel® Xeon® processor E5-2697 v4  45MB cache, 2.30 GHz single-threaded

#Example 2: Check a given list of private keys (multiplication)
cat privkeys.txt – The source of HEX-encoded private keys to search for (can be a file or a generator program). -b Use hash160 as a bloom filter to search for. -a Which type of hash160 to search for (c – compressed, u – uncompressed, cu checks for both). -t Use 1 thread.

cat privkeys.txt | ./Brainmk brain -b target.blf -t 1 -a uc

Alternatively, send him the hexadecimal private key generated by the script for processing.

#Example 4: Generate a Bloom Filter
cat reads a list of hexadecimal-encoded hash160 values from a file. -n specifies the number of entries (hash value count) in the Bloom filter. -o defines where in the output the filter is written (.blf requires an extension).

The best practice for the -n parameter is to estimate the total number of entries to be stored as accurately as possible and set that as the value of -n. The bloomer will automatically generate an optimal bloom file.


The Bloom filter uses p = 0.000001 (1 in 1,000,000 false positives). You can adjust this option by using n. See the Bloom filter calculator. A list of all addresses can be found here.



```
cat target.txt | ./Brainmk bloom -n 1024 -o target.blf

creating bloom filter: n = 1,024 | p = 1:1,000,000,000 | m = 44,167 (0.0 MB)
added 10 items; saving to target.blf
