# Brain Money Killer

Note that this is a forked modification and reimplementation https://github.com/vladkens/ecloop

A high-performance, CPU-optimized tool with the ability to search compressed and uncompressed addresses, 
as well as customizable puzzle-based searches for private keys and brainwallet searches.


# Features
1. üçè Fixed 256-bit modulo operations, fixed a private key partitioning issue, fixed the secp256k1 core, improved speed, and used AVX2 sha256 and ripemd160 2. for high-speed computation.
3. üîÑ Group inversion of point addition
4. üçá Precomputed tables for integral multiplication
5. üîç Search for compressed and uncompressed public keys (hash160)
6. üåü Optimized sha256 and ripemd160 using SIMD and AVX2 (using SHA extensions for ARM and Intel)
7. üçé Runs seamlessly on macOS and Linux
8. üîß Customizable search range and number of threads for flexible usage

# usage
```
./Brainmk -h
Usage: ./Brainmk -m <mode> [options]
v8891689, developed by 8891689

Modes (-m):
  puzzle          Puzzle solving mode. Searches for keys in a given range.
  brain           Brainwallet mode. Reads keys or passphrases from standard input.
  bloom           Generate a bloom filter from stdin.

Common Options:
  -b <file>       Bloom filter file for quick checks.
  -f <file>       Hash list file for final confirmation.
  -o <file>       Output file for found keys (default: stdout).
  -t <threads>    Number of threads to use (default: 1).
  -a <addr_type>  Address type: 'c' (compressed), 'u' (uncompressed), 'cu' (both). Default: c.
  -q              Quiet mode (no status updates to stdout).

Puzzle Mode Options:
  -r <start:end>  Search range in hexadecimal format (required for puzzle mode).
  -R              Enable random mode. Jump to a new random key after approximately 100 million checks. P.S.: Now jump to a new random key after 1 million private keys.

Brain Mode Options:
  -sha            Treat stdin lines as passphrases, hash them with SHA256 to get private keys.




Other commands:

  bloom         - create bloom filter from list of hex-encoded hash160
```
# Instructions: Brainmk <command> [-t <number of threads>] [-f <file path>] [-a <addr type>] [-r <range>]

Calculation command:

0. Modes (-m):
  puzzle          Puzzle solving mode. Searches for keys in a given range.
  brain           Brainwallet mode. Reads keys or passphrases from standard input.
  bloom           Generate a bloom filter from stdin.

1. puzzle: Performs an efficient search within a given range, suitable for puzzle games.

2. brain: Searches from standard input. Defaults to a hexadecimal private key; brainwallet attacks require the -sha flag.

Calculation options:

1. -f <file>: Hash list file for second confirmation.
2. -b <file>: Bloom filter file.
3. -o <file>: Specifies the output file to save the found key (defaults to standard output).
4. -t <threads>: Sets the number of threads to run (default: 1).
5. -a <addr_type>: Sets the address type to search: c - addr33, u - addr65 (default: c).
6. -r <range>: Specifies the search range, in hexadecimal format (e.g., 8000:ffff, defaults to searching all).
7. -q: Silent mode (no output to standard output; you must specify an output file with -o).
8. -sha: (For brainwallet mode) Treats the standard input line as a raw text password and encrypts the computed private key using SHA256.


Other commands:

9. bloom: Creates a Bloom filter from a list of hexadecimal-encoded hash160 values.

# Example 1: Check for keys in a given range (append sequentially)

1. -f is the filter file with hash160 to search. This can be a list of hex-encoded hashes (one per line) or a bloom filter (must have a .blf extension). 
2. -t uses 4 threads. 
3. ‚Äìr is the start:end of the search range. 
4. -o is the file where the found keys should be saved (if not provided, stdout is padded). 
No 
5. -a option is provided, so c will check the (compressed) hash160. 
6. Test platform: Linux/Debian, Intel¬Æ Xeon¬Æ processor E5-2697 v4  45MB cache, 2.30 GHz single-threaded

# Example 4: Generate a Bloom Filter

1. cat reads a list of hexadecimal-encoded hash160 values from a file. 
2. -n specifies the number of entries (hash value count) in the Bloom filter. 
3. -o defines where in the output the filter is written (.blf requires an extension).
4. The best practice for the -n parameter is to estimate the total number of entries to be stored as accurately as possible and set that as the value of -n.
5. The bloomer will automatically generate an optimal bloom file.
6. The Bloom filter uses p = 0.000001 (1 in 1,000,000 false positives). You can adjust this option by using n. 
7. See the Bloom filter calculator. A list of all addresses can be found here.

```
cat target.txt | ./Brainmk -m bloom -n 1024 -o target.blf

creating bloom filter: n = 1,024 | p = 1:1,000,000,000 | m = 44,167 (0.0 MB)
added 10 items; saving to target.blf
```


# windows platform
```
type target.txt | Brainmk.exe -m bloom -n 1024 -o target.blf


Brainmk.exe -m puzzle -b target.blf -t 1 -r 1:ffffff

type target.txt | Brainmk.exe -m brain -f target.txt -b target.blf -a cu -t 1

wandian.exe | Brainmk.exe -m brain -f target.txt -b target.blf -a cu -t 1 -sha
```
```
wandian.exe -h

Usage: wandian [-n num] [-t threads] [-l length] [-c charset] [-R] [-o output file]
-n num: Number of passwords to generate (valid only with -o)
-t threads: Number of threads to use (default: 4)
-l length: Password length range (e.g., 3-4)
-c charset: Character set to use (e.g., d, u, i, h, j, k, s, all)
Multiple sets can be separated by commas, e.g., -c d,u,i
-R: Generates a random password (infinite generation)
-o outputFile: Output file name (valid only with -n)

d | 0123456789 [0-9]
u | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz [a-z]
i | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ [A-Z]
h | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 [0-9a-zA-Z]
j | 0123456789ABCDEF [0-9A-F]
k | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ [a-zA-Z]
s | !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
all | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'\",.<>?/`~"

```
Note that the generator will produce passwords longer than 13 characters, requiring -R, as the increment would exceed the count limit.
